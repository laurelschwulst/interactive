  <p>You’re making art on a computer, so you could technically work from a house or apartment. You have a studio, though. Is it a space thing?</p>

  <p>It’s not a space thing. It’s totally a mental health decision. That white desk over there [points]—I carried it over from my apartment, because I’m just a 10-minute walk away, so then my programmer could sit in my space. There have been times when I have worked from home. But I find that actually leaving the space where I sleep and live and where things are maybe softer and messier is really mentally helpful.</p>

  <p>My top priority in a space is that there’s good sunlight. There’s a way that I think about myself as a plant, where I try to drink a lot of water during the day; I try to make sure that I’m near a window. Also, I have this view to Queens, so I can do that thing where I’m staring at my screen and once in awhile, I don’t even have to think about it, I naturally just look out the window. It’s good for my eyes. It’s also really epic to look across the canal at the buildings.</p>

  <p>As an artist who works on a computer, you’re sitting down all the time. I know you’re into rock climbing. I’m curious about how something like exercise fits into your practice and helps you avoid burning out.</p>

  <p>The opposite of looking out the window is looking at Twitter or something, right? Looking out the window, you’re looking out at the vast world. The thing that I would put primary in front of even something like rock climbing is that I’ve always been a bicyclist; since I moved to New York City, because New York City is actually a pretty small city geographically, I can bike around the whole city in a couple of hours. I usually don’t go that far, so it feels really accessible.</p>
